    "# Federated Learning for Decentralized AI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of federated learning (FL), a decentralized approach to training AI models where data remains on local devices (clients) and only model updates are shared with a central server. We will use the Flower (Flwr) framework to simulate a federated learning setup with multiple clients and a central server. The example uses a simple neural network for classification on a synthetic dataset (or MNIST as an alternative), showcasing the core concepts of FL, including local training, model aggregation, and evaluation."
