```

## Configuration

### Avaren AI relies on JSON configuration files to manage settings for different environments and components. These files are located in the configs/ directory. Review and modify them as needed for your setup:

- dev.json: Development environment settings with verbose logging and debug mode enabled for easier troubleshooting.
- prod.json: Production environment settings optimized for performance and security, with minimal logging.
- test.json: Testing environment settings with mock services and isolated data to prevent interference with live systems.
- solana_config.json: Solana network configurations, including RPC endpoints and WebSocket URLs for mainnet, testnet, and devnet.
- ai_config.json: AI model settings, including hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size), training schedules, and evolution parameters.
- backend_config.json: Backend API settings, such as port number, database connection strings, and cache configurations.
- frontend_config.json: Frontend DApp settings, including API endpoints, supported wallet providers, and theme options.
- governance_config.json: Governance parameters, such as voting thresholds, proposal submission costs, and quorum requirements.
- marketplace_config.json: Marketplace settings, including transaction fees, listing rules, and supported asset categories.

**Important Security Note**: Do not hardcode sensitive information (e.g., API keys, private keys, database credentials) in configuration files. Use environment variables or a .env file for such data. Example:
```
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/Avaren_db"
export SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"
```

**To load environment variables, create a .env file in the root directory or use a tool like dotenv. Refer to the .env.example file for required variables.**

### Build and Deploy
#### 1. Build All Components:
Compile smart contracts, build backend services, and bundle frontend assets using the all-in-one build script.
```
./build_all.sh
```
This script ensures that Rust contracts are compiled to WebAssembly, Node.js backend code is transpiled, and React frontend is bundled for deployment.

#### 2. Deploy Solana Smart Contracts:
Deploy the compiled smart contracts to the desired Solana network (e.g., devnet for testing).
```
./deploy_contract.sh devnet
```
Ensure your Solana wallet is funded with SOL for deployment fees (use solana airdrop 2 on devnet for test funds). The script outputs contract addresses; save these for configuration in solana_config.json.

#### 3. Start Backend Services:
Launch the backend API server to handle off-chain requests and blockchain interactions.
```
./start_backend.sh
```
By default, the backend runs on port 3000 (configurable in backend_config.json). Verify it is running by accessing http://localhost:3000/health for a status check.

#### 4. Start Frontend DApp:
Launch the frontend decentralized application with hot reloading for development.
```
./start_frontend.sh
```
The DApp runs on port 8080 by default (configurable in frontend_config.json). Open http://localhost:8080 in a supported browser to interact with the platform.

#### 5. Optional: Containerized Deployment with Docker:
For consistent environments or production deployment, use Docker to containerize the application.
```
docker-compose up --build
```
Ensure docker-compose.yml is configured with the appropriate environment variables and volume mounts.


## Usage
### Running the Application

- Backend API: Runs on the port specified in backend_config.json (default: 3000). Access endpoints at http://localhost:3000. Refer to the API documentation in /docs/api for available endpoints and request formats.
- Frontend DApp: Runs on the port specified in frontend_config.json (default: 8080). Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to access the user interface. Connect a Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom) to interact with the blockchain.
- AI Agents: Deploy and train AI models locally by following the detailed guide in /ai/README.md. This includes setting up the environment for machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and running training scripts.

### Creating and Managing AI Agents

1. Initialize an AI Agent:
Use the frontend DApp to create a new AI agent by navigating to the “Create Agent” section. Specify initial parameters such as purpose (e.g., trading, governance) and behavioral traits.
2. Local Deployment:
Download the AI model template from the platform and deploy it locally using the instructions in /ai/deployment.md. Ensure your device meets the hardware requirements for training.
3. Training and Evolution:
Train the AI agent with user-specific data or interactions. The model evolves based on hyperparameters defined in ai_config.json, creating unique story chapters viewable in the DApp.
4. Sync with Blockchain:
Periodically sync the AI agent’s metadata (e.g., evolution state, story progress) to the Solana blockchain via the DApp to ensure persistence and verifiability.

### Interacting with the Marketplace

1. Listing an Asset:
Use the “Marketplace” section of the DApp to list AI agents, services, or digital assets for sale. Configure pricing and terms as per marketplace_config.json rules.
2. Purchasing Assets:
Browse available listings, connect your Solana wallet, and complete transactions using SOL or supported tokens. Fees are automatically deducted based on configured rates.
3. Managing Listings:
Update or delist your assets through the DApp interface. Transaction history and ownership records are stored on-chain for transparency.


### Participating in Governance

1. Submit a Proposal:
Navigate to the “Governance” section in the DApp to submit proposals for platform changes (e.g., fee adjustments, feature additions). Pay the proposal cost as defined in governance_config.json.
2. Vote on Proposals:
Review active proposals and cast votes using your governance tokens or staked SOL. Voting power and thresholds are configurable parameters.
3. Monitor Outcomes:
Track proposal status and outcomes on-chain via the DApp or Solana explorers like Solscan or Solana Beach.

### Testing
Run comprehensive test suites across all components (smart contracts, backend, frontend, AI models) with coverage reporting:
```
./run_tests.sh
```
- Smart Contract Tests: Use Anchor’s testing framework to simulate blockchain interactions.
- Backend Tests: Use Jest or Mocha for API endpoint and logic testing.
- Frontend Tests: Use React Testing Library for UI component validation.
- AI Model Tests: Validate model accuracy and evolution logic with predefined datasets.
Test results and coverage reports are saved in /tests/reports for review. For isolated testing, ensure test.json is used as the active configuration.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- System Health Monitoring:
Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage for backend and local AI training processes.
```
./monitor_system.sh
```
Logs and metrics are saved to /logs for analysis.

- Database Backup:
Perform regular backups of off-chain databases for disaster recovery.
```
./backup_db.sh
```
Backups are stored in /backups with timestamps.

- API Documentation Generation:
Generate up-to-date API documentation from code annotations for developer reference.
```
./generate_docs.sh
```
Documentation is saved in /docs/api and accessible via the backend server if configured.

- Log Rotation and Cleanup:
Automate log rotation and cleanup of temporary files to maintain system performance.
```
./cleanup.sh
```

## Troubleshooting
Encountering issues? Check the following common problems and solutions. For unresolved issues, open a GitHub Issue or join our Discord for support.

#### Solana CLI or Anchor Installation Fails:
- Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed correctly (rustc --version).
- Reinstall Solana CLI with sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)".
- For Anchor, use --locked flag to avoid dependency mismatches.

#### Smart Contract Deployment Errors:
- Verify your wallet has sufficient SOL for deployment fees (solana balance).
- Check solana_config.json for correct network endpoint.
- Use solana airdrop 2 on devnet for test funds.

#### Backend API Fails to Start:
- Confirm port 3000 (or configured port) is not in use (lsof -i :3000).
- Check logs in /logs/backend.log for specific errors (e.g., database connection issues).
- Ensure environment variables like DATABASE_URL are set.

#### Frontend DApp Not Loading:
- Verify backend API is running and accessible at the configured endpoint.
- Clear browser cache or use incognito mode to avoid stale data.
- Check console errors in browser developer tools for clues.

#### AI Model Training Errors:
- Ensure required libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are installed (pip list).
- Check hardware compatibility (e.g., GPU support if enabled in ai_config.json).
- Refer to /ai/README.md for environment setup troubleshooting.

#### Network Connectivity Issues:
- Test Solana RPC endpoint connectivity (solana cluster-version).
- Switch to an alternative endpoint in solana_config.json if the default fails.

#### Logs Location: All logs are stored in /logs with timestamps for debugging. Use tail -f /logs/*.log for real-time monitoring.
